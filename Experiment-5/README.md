# Experiment 5: Neural Networks

This experiment focuses on implementing **Neural Networks** for handwritten character recognition.

## Dataset

* Source: [English Handwritten Characters Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhruvildave/english-handwritten-characters-dataset)
* Description: The dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten English characters (A–Z), used for supervised classification tasks.

## Models Implemented

1. **Single Layer Perceptron (PLA)**
2. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**

## Steps Involved

1. Data preprocessing (normalization, reshaping, one-hot encoding).
2. Implementing the Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA).
3. Implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using backpropagation.
4. Training both models on the dataset.
5. Evaluation using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**.
